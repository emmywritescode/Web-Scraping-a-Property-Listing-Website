## Introduction
This project leverages Python's versatility in performing web scraping and data cleaning operations before analysis and visualization was completed in Power BI. Real-time data from [Property24](https://www.property24.com.ng/1-bedroom-properties-to-rent-in-lagos-p37?), a local property listings website was scrapped. The goal of the project was to make a single page dashboard that helps property renters find their dream home.
